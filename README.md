This editor uses markdown because it is easy to read and it can be made into documents easily

I have added 1 special thing to this markdown though
```md
**Texas A&M University** - College Station, TX || 05/2026 
```
The || is a split. This means all the stuff to the left of the || is left alligned and all the stuff to the right of the || is right alligned

The markdown editor has a pretty handy feature where you can do `ALT + /` on any selected lines and it will comment them out quicky including and excluding them from the reusme

Next is the knowlege bank. Here is the content you will be giving the AI for tuning. Anything that is not in the resume could be good to have. Some voulenteer or military experience that is not in the content of the resume is good to have. Also having deep descriptions with tons of numbers and data that the AI can use to make a better taylored resume could also be nice.

## Usage
Step one is hitting the new project button

You should now see somehting like

Step 1 is naming the project. Give it a name that describes the resume

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1edc2163-7b4a-4495-8a01-33502e2af2d7)

Once you have named it, hit the save button.
and you should see the light turn green and the project be added to the sidebar

Changing the name will also update it in the sidebar

Next go and get the job description and paste it into the other box. You can try pasting a link and using that but it is not gaurenteed to work. In my image I had to manually copy and paste it since they have some server side stuff going on.

Step two is heading to the tuning tab

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6a2dbc0b-57d9-45e6-b942-fd9488922028)

Here you will see a score given to your resume as well as some keywords you may want to try to match.

If you think some keywords are bogus or want some custom ones on there then head to the settings editor and scroll down

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/bd8041db-7b87-40e1-bbf6-c3349452e764)

Here you can delete or add keywords of your chosing!

After typing in your resume to rescore it, You should see that your selections are in there
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d20dda17-6407-456f-ae0e-077bb1fd271c)

Now if you setup the AI tuning earlier you can hit tune resume and it will pass it off to the AI of choise and modify the resume. Once its done you can see the changes instantly. If you do not like it feel free to hit the reset button next to the title to go back to the original template.

Next is the preview
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/da98b20c-b6a5-40dc-8bc1-30a31a1e9232)

Nothing much to do here. Just take a look at the resume and make sure its not leaking off of the page.

Finally hit download

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9d08d54a-6735-4e49-83d8-44430e8a03a1)

Once you press it, the browser will open a new tab with print options. Make sure that your resume fits the page and print to pdf.

And you are done! Good luck on the job hunt!

You can then make a new project and come back to this one anytime from the sidebar.

## Other things
The applicaiton has a reset option in the settings, this will delete everything!

The application has a download and upload data button. This lets you move the data from one computer to another or share all your data to a friend (note this will also share your api key so just be aware of that.
