This diverse skill set allows me to tackle various development tasks, from low-level system programming to high-level web application development.

I am also experienced in using technologies like Linux, Node.js, Svelte, Astro.js, MySQL, MongoDB, Postgres, Git, Docker, Heroku, GCP, PyTorch, TensorFlow, Qt, and GTK. These tools enable me to build, deploy, and manage complex software systems effectively. Furthermore, I am well-versed in methodologies such as Agile, Scrum, OOP, Functional Programming, DevOps, CI/CD, and TDD, ensuring that I can contribute to projects using modern development practices.

## 2. Experience

As a Teaching Assistant at Texas A&M University for CS 111 - Intro to Programming Concepts, I proctor lab sessions for 23 students weekly, providing real-time assistance with Java coding assessments. This role has honed my ability to explain complex concepts clearly and efficiently. Additionally, I grade over 180 weekly submissions, reviewing student code for correctness and efficiency, ensuring timely feedback and contributing to improved class performance.

This experience has not only reinforced my understanding of fundamental programming concepts but also developed my communication and mentoring skills. Providing assistance during lab sessions requires quick problem-solving and the ability to explain solutions in a way that students can understand. Grading assignments involves meticulous attention to detail and a thorough understanding of coding best practices.

## 3. Project Experience

### Personal Website

For my personal website, a self-led full-stack web development project, I optimized blog performance to achieve load times under 100ms, a 66% improvement, by implementing AstroJS for static site generation and converting images to WebP format. This optimization significantly enhanced the user experience by reducing page load times and improving overall site performance.

I also engineered a scalable backend infrastructure using Node.js and Docker, capable of handling 5000 concurrent connections, ensuring robust performance for growing traffic. Developing a bespoke Content Management System (CMS) allowed me to avoid vendor lock-in and incorporate custom features like dynamic tech keyword highlighting and hyperlinking, enhancing content interactivity. Finally, I implemented a streamlined CI/CD pipeline with GitHub Actions, automating static HTML generation and Docker deployment, resulting in a 1-minute build time and supporting over 1,500 monthly site versions.

### Cabin Connect (TAMUhack 2025)

In the TAMUhack 2025 project, Cabin Connect, which won the "Best Use of Cloudflare" award, I engineered Cloudflare Tunnels and Zero Trust infrastructure to reduce global latency to under 200ms by leveraging over 300 edge locations. This ensured 100% uptime during the judging process, demonstrating the reliability and efficiency of the system.

I architected a custom synchronization system using MongoDB Atlas, polling at 1Hz intervals to achieve state consistency within 2 seconds across 10+ watch parties through JSON. Integrating Three.js and Threlte 3D engines allowed for rendering over 10,000 polygons at 60FPS on low-power devices. Additionally, I developed a Gemini API recommendation system that parsed over 100 TMDB entries per query with 100ms response times, achieving 92% accuracy in semantic movie matching using Gemini Flash 2.0 Experimental.

### SignSense

For the SignSense project, a sign language learning web application, I developed a real-time sign language recognition system capable of identifying 26 English alphabet gestures with 80% accuracy using FastAPI and Python. This system enhances accessibility by enabling real-time sign language recognition for multiple users.

I implemented a Docker-based deployment strategy, streamlining the integration of the machine learning model with the Svelte frontend, resulting in a seamless user experience across devices. Architecting a robust API using FastAPI facilitated real-time communication between the frontend and the sign recognition model, handling 120 image requests per minute.

### Panda POS

In the Panda POS project, a full-stack web development team project, I engineered a scalable Point of Sale system using Astro.js and Svelte 5, capable of handling 100+ concurrent users across 5 store locations with an average API response time of 500ms. This system provides efficient transaction processing and management capabilities.

I implemented a robust Node.js backend with PostgreSQL and Drizzle ORM, processing 600+ daily transactions and achieving 100% uptime throughout the project duration. Utilizing BetterAuth and GitHub OAuth, I created a secure authentication system, ensuring protected access for 100+ users across multiple role levels.

### Homelab

My homelab project involves architecting and maintaining a robust infrastructure running 19 active Dockerized services across multiple nodes, achieving 99.9% uptime. This project has honed my system administration and networking skills.

I implemented enterprise-grade security measures using Cloudflare Tunnels and Tailscale VPN, reducing the external attack surface by 89% while maintaining seamless remote access to 17 internal services. Developing comprehensive documentation using Obsidian, creating a knowledge base of 100+ technical issues and solutions, has reduced future troubleshooting time by 60%.

## 4. Events

### TAMUhack 2025

At TAMUhack 2025, our team strategized and implemented live pair programming via VSCode LiveShare during a 24-hour development sprint, achieving 100% feature completion ahead of the deadline. This collaborative approach allowed us to leverage each team member's strengths and ensure efficient development.

We also orchestrated a judging demo for 5 industry experts, delivering a 97% flawless execution rate through team dry-runs and role-playing technical Q&A scenarios. This meticulous preparation ensured that we could effectively communicate our project's value and functionality to the judges.

### Tamu Datathon

In the Tamu Datathon, I developed an AI engine for Pop Tic Tac Toe using Python, implementing a bitboard representation and minimax algorithm with alpha-beta pruning. This resulted in a 0.15-second average response time, showcasing the efficiency of the algorithm.

I optimized performance through 8 iterative versions, incorporating advanced techniques like transposition tables and move ordering to efficiently search an 8x8 game grid, resulting in a placement of 13th out of 23 teams. This iterative approach allowed me to refine the algorithm and improve its performance over time.
